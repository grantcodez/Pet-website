<h1>Pet Website</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This is an ongoing project to build a pet website. I have designed the basic layout of the website including all the navigation tabs with information about different animals and a consultation page that allows you to enter your information in a form in order to get approved for adoption. I will be continuing to add functionality so stay tuned.
